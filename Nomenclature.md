## Blockchain

Blockchain is a mode for building an unforgeable, unchangeable and traceable block chain data structure through transparent and trustworthy rules in a peer-to-peer network environment to realize and manage transaction processing. Note: Transaction processing includes but is not limited to the generation, access and use of trusted data.

## Block

In the Bitcoin network, data is permanently recorded in the form of files, which we call blocks. A block is a record set of some or all of the latest Bitcoin transactions, and has not been recorded by other previous blocks.

## Block header

he block header stores the block header information, including the hash value of the previous block (PreHash), the hash value of the block body (Hash), and the timestamp (TimeStamp), etc.

## Satoshi Nakamoto

Claiming to be a Japanese American, Japanese media often translates as Nakamoto Tetsushi. This person is the creator of the Bitcoin protocol and related software Bitcoin-Qt, but his true identity is unknown.

## Cryptocurrency

Encrypted currency is a type of digital currency (or virtual currency). It is a transaction medium that uses cryptographic principles to ensure transaction security and control the creation of transaction units.

## Node

A node is a device or computer that is connected to the blockchain network and allows it to operate and maintain.

## Oracles

By providing data to smart contracts, Oracle is a bridge between the real world and the blockchain.

## Decentralization

Decentralization is a phenomenon or structure that can only appear or exist in a system with many nodes or in a group with many individuals. The influence between nodes will form a non-linear causal relationship through the network.

## Consensus mechanism

The calculation method adopted by each node in the blockchain system to reach a consensus, through the voting of special nodes, complete the verification and confirmation of the transaction in a short time; for a transaction, if several nodes with irrelevant interests can By reaching a consensus, we can assume that the entire network can also reach a consensus on this.

## PoW

Proof of Work refers to how much profit you get depends on the amount of work you contribute to mining. The better the computer performance, the more mines will be allocated to you.

## PoS

Proof of Stake is a system of interest distribution based on the amount and time of currency you hold. In the POS mode, your "mining" income is proportional to your coin age, and has nothing to do with the computer's computing performance.

## Smart contract

A contract defined in digital form that can rigidly execute terms. In the field of blockchain technology, a smart contract refers to a computer program that is triggered based on a predetermined event, cannot be tampered with, and is rigidly executed.

## Timestamp

The timestamp is used to indicate the creation time scale (positive integer) of the block and the transaction. The commonly used standard is the UNIX timestamp, which is defined as the time from 00: 00: 00 on January 1, 1970, GMT to the present The total number of seconds.

## Turing complete

In computability theory, when a set of data manipulation rules (a set of instruction sets, programming languages, cellular automata) satisfy any data in a certain order, the result can be calculated, which is called Turing Complete.

## 51% attack

When a single individual or a group has more than half of the computing power, this individual or group can control the entire cryptocurrency network. If they have some malicious ideas, they may issue some conflicting transactions to damage the entire network.

## Dapp

It is an open source application that runs automatically, stores its data on the blockchain, incentivizes it in the form of cryptographic tokens, and operates with a protocol that shows proof of value.

## DAO

It can be thought of as a company that operates without any human intervention, and delegates all forms of control to a set of indestructible business rules.

## DistributedLedger

Data is stored through a distributed node network. The distributed ledger does not have to have its own currency, it may be licensed and private.

## DistributedNetwork

Processing power and data are distributed on nodes instead of a network with centralized data centers.

## Oracle

An oracle is a trusted entity that introduces information about the state of the external world through signatures, allowing certain smart contracts to react to the uncertain external world. The oracle has the characteristics of non-tampering, stable service, auditable, etc., and has an economic incentive mechanism to ensure the power of operation.

## Zero-knowledge proof

Zero-knowledge proof means that the prover can convince the verifier that a certain assertion is correct without providing any useful information to the verifier.

## Key

In cryptography, a key refers to a piece of secret information used to complete cryptographic applications such as encryption, decryption, and verification. Different cryptographic algorithms have different key types. When it is necessary to complete the signature and verification, the asymmetric key algorithm is mainly used. The asymmetric key algorithms commonly used in blockchains are mainly elliptic line cryptographic algorithms, such as Secp256k1 and Curve25519.

## AES——Advanced Encryption Standard

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in cryptography, also known as Rijndael encryption, is a block encryption standard adopted by the US Federal Government.

## Wallet

A file containing the private key. It usually contains a software client that allows access to view and create transactions on a specific blockchain designed by the wallet.

## Cold wallet

Generally speaking, a cold wallet is a wallet that stores digital currency offline. Players generate digital currency addresses and private keys on an offline wallet, and then save them. The cold wallet stores digital currency without any network, so hackers cannot enter the wallet to obtain the private key.

## SPV——Light wallet

Light wallets rely on other full nodes on the Bitcoin network and only synchronize data related to themselves, which can basically achieve decentralization.

## Full node

A full node is a node with a complete blockchain ledger. The full node needs to occupy memory to synchronize all blockchain data, can independently verify all transactions on the blockchain and update data in real time, and is mainly responsible for the broadcast of blockchain transactions And verification.

## Byzantinefailures——Byzantine Generals problem

The Byzantine Generals problem is a basic problem in peer-to-peer communication proposed by Leslie Lambert. The implication is that it is impossible to try to achieve consistency through message delivery on an unreliable channel with message loss. Therefore, the research on consistency generally assumes that the channel is reliable, or there is no such problem.

## Hyperledger

Hyperledger is an open source project initiated by the Linux Foundation in 2015 to promote blockchain digital technology and transaction verification. By creating a common distributed ledger technology, assisting organizations to expand and establish industry-specific applications, platforms and hardware systems to support members' respective trading businesses.

## Lightning Network

The purpose of the Lightning Network is to securely conduct off-chain transactions. In essence, it uses a hash time-locked smart contract to securely conduct zero-confirmation transactions. By setting up clever “smart contracts”, users can be Unconfirmed transactions on the Internet are as safe as gold.

## P2P——Peer-to-peer network

Peer-to-peer computer network is a distributed application architecture that distributes tasks and workloads among peers. It is a networking or network form formed by the peer-to-peer computing model at the application layer.

## Mining

Mining is the nickname for the exploration method for obtaining Bitcoin. The process of using computer hardware to calculate the location of the currency and obtain it is called mining.

## miner
 A computing devices or software try to create blocks and add them to the blockchain. In a blockchain network, when a new valid block is created, the system generally automatically gives the block creator (miner) a certain amount of tokens as a reward.

## Mining pool

It is a fully automatic mining platform that allows miners to contribute their own computing power to mine together to create blocks, obtain block rewards, and distribute profits according to the percentage of computing power contribution (that is, the mining machine is connected to the mining pool-providing computing Power—getting income)

## Public chain

A completely open blockchain refers to a blockchain that can be read by anyone, anyone can send transactions, and transactions can be effectively confirmed, people all over the world can participate in system maintenance, and anyone can trade or mine Mine reads and writes data.

## Private chain

The blockchain only provide write permission to a certain organization or a specific minority of objects. Reading permissions can be open to the outside world, or restricted to any degree.

## Alliance chain

A blockchain with consensus mechanismthat which is jointly controlled by a number of designated institutions.

## Main chain

The term main chain comes from mainnet (as opposed to testnet), which is an independent blockchain network officially launched.

## Side chain

Pegged sidechains, it will realize the transfer of Bitcoin and other digital assets between multiple blockchains, which means that users can access new assets while using their existing assets. Cryptocurrency system.

## Cross-chain technology

Cross-chain technology can be understood as a bridge connecting various blockchains. Its main application is to realize atomic transactions between various blockchains, asset conversion, internal information exchange between blockchains, or to solve Oracle problems.

## Hard fork

The block chain has permanent divergence. After the new consensus rules are released, some nodes that have not been upgraded cannot verify the blocks produced by the upgraded nodes. Usually, a hard fork will occur.

## Soft fork

When the new consensus rules are released, the nodes that have not upgraded will produce illegal blocks because they do not know the new consensus rules, and temporary forks will occur.

## Hash——Hash algorithm 

A hash algorithm is essentially a computer program that can receive information input of any length, and then use the hash algorithm to create a small digital "fingerprint". The binary value string of any length is mapped to a fixed-length binary value string. The rule of this mapping is the hash algorithm.

## Hashrate

Assuming that mining is to solve an equation problem, and it can only be calculated by substituting each integer, then the hash rate is the speed of processing data per second.

## Hashtree

A hash tree is a tree-shaped data structure. Each leaf node uses the hash of the data block as a label, while the non-leaf node uses the encrypted hash of its child node label as a label.

## SHA256

SHA-256 is an encryption algorithm used by a series of Bitcoin digital currencies. However, it uses a lot of computing power and processing time, forcing miners to form mining pools to obtain revenue.

## Kyc

KYC is the abbreviation of Know Your Customer, which means to know your customers. In the international "Anti-Money Laundering Law" regulations, organizations are required to have a comprehensive understanding of their customers in order to predict and discover unreasonable aspects of business behavior And potential violations.

## Private currency

China’s largest private currency is Tencent’s Q currency, which can be used in Tencent’s ecosystem. You can use RMB to buy Q currency, but you cannot use Q currency to exchange for RMB. This is a private currency in itself. Business district currency.

## Digital currency

The difference between private currency and digital currency is that private currency is a centralized institution for endorsement, while digital currency does not have a centralized institution for credit endorsement, relying on mathematical algorithms.

## Merkle Tree

Merkle tree is an important data structure of blockchain, and its function is to quickly summarize and verify the existence and integrity of block data. In a general sense, it is a way to hash a large number of data "blocks". It relies on dividing these data "blocks" into smaller units of data blocks. Each bucket block contains only a few data "blocks". , And then take each bucket unit data block to hash again, repeat the same process, until the total number of remaining hashes only becomes 1.

## SPV (Simple Payment Verification)

Simple Payment Verification (SPV) allows Decred wallets to be used without downloading the entire Decred blockchain. A wallet operating in SPV mode only needs to download the complete block containing its related transactions (ie transactions involving the wallet address). In general, this means downloading tens of megabytes instead of gigabytes. This greatly reduces the hardware requirements of the wallet and the initial loading time of a new wallet. SPV has been built directly into the dcrwallet command line interface-Decredition and other official wallets of other developers are used in the background-so all official wallet users can enable SPV.

## Bloom filter

In essence, Bloom filter is a kind of data structure, a more ingenious probabilistic data structure, which is characterized by efficient insertion and query, and can be used to tell you "something must not exist or may exist". Compared with the traditional List, Set, Map and other data structures, it is more efficient and takes up less space, but the disadvantage is that the returned results are probabilistic, not exact.

Bloom filters can be used to retrieve whether an element is in a collection. Its advantage is that the space efficiency and query time far exceed the general algorithm. The disadvantage is that it has a certain error recognition rate and deletion difficulty, but there is no recognition error situation.

## degree of difficulty

The difficulty factor is a key factor in designing the difficulty of blockchain mining. The lower the difficulty factor, the easier it is to mine. The higher the degree of difficulty, the harder the response.
