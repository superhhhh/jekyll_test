This page provides a brief guide on how you can import channel pathway profiles generated by CHAP into spreadsheet software like [Microsoft Excel][ms-excel], [Graphpad Prism][graphpad-prism], or [Origin][originlab].

CHAP writes its output to a [JSON-formatted file](http://www.channotation.org/docs/contents_json_file/), which contains several independent data sets, each of which corresponds to an individual spreadsheet table. The easiest way to load this data into a spreadsheet programme is to extract the pathway profiles into a CSV file, which can then be imported into most data processing software. CHAP already comes bundled with scripts written in [Python][Python] and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) to do exactly this.


## Python Conversion Script

A Python script for converting CHAP output to CSV format can be found under `chap/scripts/plotting/python/chap_json2csv.py`. Copy this script to your working directory and run:

```bash
./chap_json2csv.py -i output.json -o profiles.csv
```

The contents of the resulting CSV file correspond to the `pathwayProfile` field in the JSON file as [documented here](http://www.channotation.org/docs/contents_json_file/).


## R Conversion Script

Alternatively, a R script for converting CHAP output to CSV format can be found under `chap/scripts/plotting/R/chap_json2csv.R`. Copy this script to your working directory and run:

```bash
./chap_json2csv.R -i output.json -o profiles.csv
```

The contents of the resulting CSV file correspond to the `pathwayProfile` field in the JSON file as [documented here](http://www.channotation.org/docs/contents_json_file/).
