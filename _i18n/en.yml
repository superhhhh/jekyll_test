      summary: "This layout shows an example of a knowledge-base style
               navigation system, where there is no hierarchy, just
               groups of pages that have certain tags."
      alerts_note: The content on this page doesn't display well on PDF, but I
                included it anyway so you could see the problems this layout
                poses if you're including it in PDF

                         in this section. It will take you from the beginning
                         level to comfortable"
        formatting: "These topics get into formatting syntax, such as images
                     and tables, that you'll use on each of your pages:"
        publishing: When you're building, publishing, and deploying your Jekyll
                    site, you might find these topics helpful.
        content_types: This section lists different content types and how to
                       work with them.
        single_sourcing: These topics cover strategies for single_sourcing.
                    Single sourcing refers to strategies for re-using the same
                    source in different outputs for different audiences or
                    purposes.
        special_layouts: These pages highlight special layouts outside of the
                         conventional page and TOC hierarchy.
      note: This was mostly an experiment to see if I could break away
            from the hierarchical TOC and provide a different way of
            arranging the content. However, this layout is somewhat
            problematic because it doesn't allow you to browse other
            navigation options on the side while viewing a topic.
    scroll_layout:
      title: Scroll layout
      atoz: Scroll layout
      keywords: json, scrolling, scrollto, jquery plugin
      summary: "This page demonstrates how you the integration of a script
             called ScrollTo, which is used here to link definitions of a
             JSON code sample to a list of definitions for that particular
             term. The scenario here is that the JSON blocks are really
             long, with extensive nesting and subnesting, which makes it
             difficult for tables below the JSON to adequately explain the
             term in a
            usable way."
      alert_note: This was mostly an experiment to see if there was a better
                  way to document a long JSON code example. I haven't actually
                  used this approach in my own documentation.
