            <blockquote>
              <p>With the discovery of novel ion channel structures continuing at an accelerated pace there is a need for improved tools 
              that facilitate the functional annotation of these structures. The computational approach underlying CHAP is capable of rapidly identifying hydrophobic 
              gates, i.e. energetic barriers to ion permeation 
              that result from the dewetting of hydrophobic segments within the nanometre-sized pores found in most ion channels. Such hydrophobic 
              barriers are not detectable by a simple measurement of the physical dimensions of a channel pore and it is now clear that they 
              represent an important predictor of channel permeability.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Pore Hydration Analysis</h3>
            <p>CHAP goes beyond measurement of pore dimensions and facilitates an analysis of the hydration behaviour of a channel's permeation pathway. This permits fast
            identification of hydrophobic gates and thus improves the functional annotation of novel channel structures.

            <h3 class="text-center">Based on Molecular Dynamics</h3>
            <p>CHAP makes use of the popular molecular dynamics engine <a href="https://gromacs.org">Gromacs</a> to derive the biophysical properties of a channel's permeation pathway
            and thereby relates channel structure and function.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Visualisation Included</h3>
            <p>CHAP allows the visualisation of properties of the channel pore in common molecular viewers like <a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a> and 
            <a href="https://pymol.org">PyMOL</a>. Scripts for plotting results using R and Python are also included.</p>
